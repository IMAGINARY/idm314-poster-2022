2022 IDM Poster with the theme "Mathematics Unites"

## The spiral background

The spiral background was created with a simple program, which you can find in the `spiral-bg` 
folder.

To run it, place all files in the directory in a web server. You might also try opening them
directly with your web browser, but that might not work. Try the latest version of Google Chrome
if your browser does not work.

You can look at the algorithm in `src/spiral-bg/index.js`. The sources are commented, and you can
use them to experiment and create variations on the pattern.
